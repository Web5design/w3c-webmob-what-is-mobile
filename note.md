% A note on the meaning of "mobile" and relationship to the Webmob Charter


# Introduction
The term "mobile" is used both in the name of the Webmob IG and widely used in the Mission Statement and Scope sections of its [Charter](http://www.w3.org/2013/07/webmobile-ig-charter.html). Specifically the mission statement states that the purpose of the group is *to accelerate the development of Web technology so that it becomes a compelling platform for mobile applications and the obvious choice for cross platform development*.

The term is overloaded with many meanings and presumptions. The purpose of this position paper is to clarify how the Webmob IG interprets *mobile* in order to clarify its charter and its scope of interest.

# It's about the user, not the device

While use of the term mobile is "broadly speaking" understandable to a wide and non-specialist audience, for a more specialist audience it might convey that we confine our attention to devices that are portable or might further indicate that we are only interested in devices that can be used in motion. Neither is the case. In any case it sparks debate about which devices are mobile and which are not. One of the points that this paper aims to address is that the scope of Webmob is not determined by device properties, but is concerned with the context in which a person uses a product or service delivered using Web technology.

The device in use is part of that context, but only one part of it. Indeed, a focus of our work and a chartered deliverable *Multi-device and cross-device user experiences on the Web* makes it clear that we consider a specific part of what we are doing to consider the already common phenomenon of the same Web product or service being perceived by the same person using two, three or more devices. It is very likely that in developed economies at least one of those devices is a desktop computer. Historically such devices have not been considered mobile, rather the term mobile has been used as a contrast to the context in which such devices are often or usually used. In other words, mobile, though apparently having a connotation of "mobile telephone" has historically been better interpreted as "use in a context other than sitting at a desk". Such contexts have historically included use of devices such as kiosks (which are literally immobile), set top boxes, tablets, interactive displays and indeed everything else through which the Web may be perceived and interacted with.

By including cross-device experiences in the remit of the group, even this broad distinction is too limited. It seems sensible to look at the experience of perceiving the Web when seated at a desk not as a distinct experience but one which falls into a spectrum or range of contexts of use, albeit at an extreme end of some of the properties we may use to describe that context. It might be argued that in that sense *mobile* means 'everything' and therefore 'nothing'. However, that's only true when you're looking for mobile to mean a distinction between devices. In reality, from the perspective of the IG, mobile is actually a code word for being aware of and distinguishing properties of the various delivery contexts, with the objective of improving a user's experience of perceiving the Web in a range of contexts.

Most importantly, we are interested in the ability of a user to achieve a task or goal, using the Web in a wider variety of contexts, where their engagement continues while the context changes in both gradual and abrupt ways. Gradual, such as the change in ambient light, abrupt such as switching from using a mobile phone to using a desktop computer on reaching home or office.

# Properties of the Contextual Experience

- Connectivity Properties

    - The bandwidth available and its variation over time

    - The round trip delay and its variation over time

    - Variable rate charging depending on volume and location

- Location and Time of Use Properties

    - The place of use may vary over time and the user may be in motion during use

    - Ambient noise or light may not be optimal

    - The user may have a restricted range of motion available for interaction (one handed, or hands-free)

    - The userâ€™s attention may not be primarily focused on using the application or service

- Device Properties

    - Display area and resolution

    - Processing power, memory and storage

    - Human interaction mechanisms

        - may not consist of a keyboard or mouse and may include touch and haptics and other means of interaction.

    - The range of sensors

        - Camera, accelerometer, compass, geo-location ...

    - Source of power

    - Software (installed firmware etc.) updates

        - May not be possible at all or practical at any point in time, for cost, speed or other reasons.

Given the wide range of properties and broad range of possible values of those properties the IG doesn't fee that it is very useful to single out particular combinations of properties for specific mention. It might be argued that desktop deserves special mention as a device that has serious limitations compared with the inherent advantages of devices that can be used effectively in a broad range of contexts. *Desktop may be strong, but it's rather stupid*.

There is some overlap with other activities within the W3C. Accessibility also concerns itself with the capabilities of the user and the nature of the user's perception of the Web. Internationalisation concerns itself with the language abilities of the user and to some degree their location.

# The Mobile Web

Given the characterisation above, it's reasonable to ask how the group interprets the term "Mobile Web".

In short, the IG prefers not to use the term in its own work, but interprets it as meaning "The Web as perceived or as optimised for delivery in a varying range of contexts" distinguished inter alia by the properties described above.

Given the above discussion of "mobile means everything" the Mobile Web is no different to "[One Web](http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp/#OneWeb)": *making, as far as is reasonable, the same information and services available to users irrespective of the device they are using. However, it does not mean that exactly the same information is available in exactly the same representation across all devices. The context of mobile use, device capability variations, bandwidth issues and mobile network capabilities all affect the representation. Furthermore, some services and information are more suitable for and targeted at particular user contexts*.

# Alternatives to the word "mobile"

It might be argued that since the IG understand that mobile can be construed as misleading but is in fact a short way of "considering the user context" is there a better term? We choose the word mobile, because for now it conveys enough about what we mean to demand limited explanation to a non-specialist audience.We await the arrival of a deeper understand of the nature of and importance of the user's context, before co-opting a term such as "Contextual Web", which while precise would today be incomprehensible.
